Instructions:
1. Carefully review each lawyer's practice areas and experience
2. Look for specific mentions of expertise related to the client's needs
3. If matches are found:
   - Recommend 2-3 lawyers from the above list, ranked by fit
   - For each recommendation, cite specific practice areas or experience that match the client's needs
   - Include their availability details
4. If no matches are found:
   - Clearly state that no lawyers in the current list have the required expertise
   - Be specific about what expertise was looked for but not found

Remember: Only recommend lawyers if their listed practice areas or experience explicitly match the client's needs."""
