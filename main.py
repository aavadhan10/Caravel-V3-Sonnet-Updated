Please analyze the client's needs and the available lawyers. If there are good matches:
1. Recommend 3-5 best matching lawyers
2. Explain specifically why each one matches the requirements
3. Include their availability details

However, if there are no lawyers who truly match the client's needs, explicitly say so and explain what specific expertise or experience is missing. Do not recommend lawyers who don't have clear evidence of the required expertise in their profiles.

Remember: It's better to say there isn't a good match than to recommend someone who doesn't have the right expertise.

Format recommendations as numbered points starting with the lawyer's name, like:

2. [Lawyer Name]: [Explanation]"""
